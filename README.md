# bingo-rand-num-choice

This project is intended to display choice of six random numbers for playing Bingo.
Users are prompted with a message of how many combinations they want to play (maximum number being 9, as after 9 combinations the numbers must repeat themselves).

In the first phase:
    - I will set up the Bingo random number generator page (includes HTML & styling of the web page)
    - Then, I will add the functionality to the webpage (needed JavaScript functions for generating random combinations of six numbers)

In the second phase:
    - The numbers on combinations shouldn't repeat themselves, instead each combination should have numbers which can't be found on other combinations.

This project is being done for fun, practicing problem solving, logical thinking, as well as my skills of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
